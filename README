This is the web server for http://patrickhenryproject.org/

The Patrick Henry Project is an idea proposed by Ann Barnhardt (http://barnhardt.biz/), her response to the actions of the Obama Administration. She posted on YouTube a recitation of Patrick Henry's famous "Give me liberty or give me death" speech and invited others to post their own. Western Rifle Shooters publicized her invitation (https://westernrifleshooters.wordpress.com/2012/01/25/barnhardt-the-patrick-henry-project/). This web server enables collection of those videos in one place.

The code should be fairly easily adaptable for collecting videos on other topics. If you do so, and if you pull out the topic-specific stuff and make it generic, I'm open to pull requests.
